Docstring:  
Driver for an IP without a more specific driver

This driver wraps an MMIO device and provides a base class
for more specific drivers written later. It also provides
access to GPIO outputs and interrupts inputs via attributes. More specific
drivers should inherit from `DefaultIP` and include a
`bindto` entry containing all of the IP that the driver
should bind to. Subclasses meeting these requirements will
automatically be registered.

Attributes
